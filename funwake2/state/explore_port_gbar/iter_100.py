"""Schedule: add a scale_pos * extremity interaction term to the terminal
alpha floor (and matching spike softening) so farms that are BOTH large-N
and unusually packed/sparse (like dei_n80_omnidir, scale_pos ~= 0.71) get
extra terminal-alpha relief beyond what the additive scale_pos + extremity
terms already give them.

Diagnosis vs. the current best: alpha_denom_floor = g_min * (1 +
ALPHA_FLOOR_SCALE_SPAN*scale_pos + ALPHA_FLOOR_EXT_SPAN*extremity) treats
"large N" and "unusual packing density" as independent, additive effects.
dei_n80_omnidir sits at scale_pos ~= 0.71 (large but not saturated) and is
the single flattest-scoring farm in the fitness set (+0.0005%), suggesting
its terminal alpha is still climbing close to native's diverging 1/lr_base
behavior late in the run even after the additive floor. Farms that are
large-N AND have a packing density far from the reference need MORE
relief than the sum of the two separate terms predicts, because both
effects independently push the native alpha0*D/lr_base ratio up. This
change adds one small multiplicative interaction term
(ALPHA_FLOOR_INTERACT_SPAN * scale_pos * extremity) to the floor, and a
matching (small, softer) interaction term to the terminal spike, so a farm
with BOTH large scale_pos and large extremity gets extra relief on both
levers, while farms with only one of the two (e.g. parque_n10/n20, which
are small-N, or dei_n50 farms, which are near-reference density) see next
to no change since the product of a near-zero term with anything is near
zero. All other machinery (self-contained inverse-time product lr decay to
gamma_min, short linear warmup, density-extremity relax/spike/hold,
absolute-N scale on hold/spike/relax_p1/beta/relax0) is unchanged from the
parent.
