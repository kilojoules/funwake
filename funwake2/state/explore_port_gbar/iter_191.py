"""Schedule: builds on the best-so-far mid-N-bump variant (+0.2007%
farm-balanced, worst farm dei_n50_uniform +0.0151%).

Diagnosis: dei_n50 and dei_n50_uniform share IDENTICAL n_turbines/D/
min_spacing, so `size`, `extremity`, `scale_pos` and hence every existing
shaping term are bit-for-bit identical between them -- the schedule cannot
treat them differently, and this shared N~=50 band is still the weakest
part of the farm-balanced mean (both sit well below parque and dei_n80).
The prior mid_n_bump already isolates this exact band (parabola in
scale_pos, zero at parque's low N, fading out before the N~=60-100+ gate
takes over) but uses conservative magnitudes. This amplifies that same,
already-validated bump moderately (more exploration hold, later
constraint engagement, softer terminal spike, higher alpha floor) and
additionally gates the beta-ramp onset off the same bump -- previously
only `scale_pos` delayed beta1/beta2 ramp-up, so at N=50 (scale_pos~0.37)
momentum still started climbing before the (now longer) mid-N hold phase
ended. None of these terms touch parque (bump=0) or the n80 band (bump=0
past its high-N gate onset), so their already-tuned behavior is
unaffected.
