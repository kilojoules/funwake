"""Schedule: extend the existing scale_pos>0.5 (N>60) gate -- previously used
only to raise the terminal alpha_denom floor -- to also soften the terminal
spike, delay the penalty-engagement ramp, and lengthen the exploration hold
specifically for farms in that high-N regime, since dei_n80_omnidir
(scale_pos ~= 0.71, high_n_gap ~= 0.21) is still marginally BELOW native
(-0.006%) even with the alpha-floor relief alone.

Diagnosis vs. the current best/parent: alpha_denom_floor already decouples
dei_n80_omnidir's terminal-alpha cap from dei_n50's via a high_n_gap-gated
quadratic term, and that closed most of the gap (parent farm-balanced score
is dominated by dei_n80_omnidir sitting just under 0). But alpha_denom is
only one of several levers that jointly determine how aggressively the
constraint penalty engages late in optimization -- spike0 (terminal
multiplier), relax_p1 (delay of the engagement ramp), and hold_frac
(exploration-plateau length before lr even starts decaying) all still scale
only with the *linear*, un-gated scale_pos term, so dei_n80_omnidir gets the
same proportionally-modest relief as any mid-large farm, while dei_n50
(scale_pos ~= 0.37, below the 0.5 gate) already sees none of these new terms
change at all. Adding small high_n_gap-gated corrections to hold_frac
(longer exploration), spike0 (softer terminal penalty spike), and relax_p1
(later full engagement) gives dei_n80_omnidir a further, compounding nudge
toward feasibility-friendly behavior without perturbing dei_n50 or the
parque farms (all of which have high_n_gap == 0). All other machinery
(self-contained inverse-time product lr decay to gamma_min, short linear
warmup, density-extremity relax/spike/hold, absolute-N scale on
hold/spike/relax_p1, the hold_frac-floored beta ramp, the quadratic
high-N alpha-floor term) is unchanged from the parent.
