"""Schedule: same mechanism as parent (+0.1952% farm-balanced) but lowers
the high-N smoothstep gate (_ALPHA_FLOOR_HIGH_N_P0) from 0.5 to 0.25 so its
already-tuned relief (alpha-floor relaxation, extra exploration hold,
delayed penalty engagement) extends partially to mid-size farms instead of
only kicking in above scale_pos=0.5 (n_turbines ~ 42+).

Diagnosis vs. parent: of the 5 known cells, dei_n50_uniform is the worst
(+0.0139%) despite having the SAME n_turbines/D/min_spacing as dei_n50
(+0.0277%) -- the two differ only in wind rose, which this schedule cannot
see directly (no wind-rose input). n=50 gives scale_pos = log(50/30)/log4
~= 0.369, which sits BELOW the old gate window [0.5, 0.78], so dei_n50 and
dei_n50_uniform got zero high_n_ramp relief under the parent -- only the
small linear *_SCALE_SPAN terms applied. Since we cannot distinguish the
two n=50 farms via inputs, the only lever is to widen the existing,
already-validated high-N relief mechanism (not invent a new one) so it
partially engages in the n~40-50 range too, on the hypothesis that the
extra exploration headroom / delayed constraint engagement that helped
dei_n80_omnidir also helps the harder of the two n=50 farms. n=10/20
(scale_pos clipped to 0) are completely unaffected by this change, so
parque_n10_omnidir and parque_n20 keep their exact parent behavior. This
is a single-constant change (_ALPHA_FLOOR_HIGH_N_P0: 0.5 -> 0.25); every
other mechanism (inverse-time product lr decay to gamma_min, short linear
warmup, density-extremity relax/spike/hold, absolute-N scale on
hold/spike/relax_p1, the alpha-floor relief span/gate structure itself,
the hold_frac-floored beta ramp) is unchanged from the parent.
